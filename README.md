## Background

As a History major, I wrote my thesis on European integration and how it has affected national political sovereignty. Students of History, both academic and casual, often find the intertwining of different levels of European integration confusing. I decide to create an easy-to-use, visual aid for those wanting to explore a continent with unique political features and how it relates to current events.
